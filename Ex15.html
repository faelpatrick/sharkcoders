<h1>DOLPHIN PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h1>
<h2>Head</h2>
<ul>
       <li>Brain
            <ul>
                <li>The brain of these cetaceans is large, and its mass is slightly greater than that of humans. 
				<br>It is 15-60 times bigger than the brain of a shark of similar size.</li>
				<br>
            </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Eyes
            <ul>
                <li>Located on each side of the head, they provide a broad field of view and are very sensitive despite the inability to identify colors. 
				<br>They can move independently of one another, but they are not able to look directly up or down.</li>
				<br>
            </ul>
       </li> 
	   <li>Ears
            <ul>
                <li>Dolphins do not have external ears, but they have small openings behind the eyes, which lead to an ear canal.</li>
				<br>
            </ul>
       </li>
	   <li>Blowhole
            <ul>
                <li>It is the orifice located at the top of the head that serves to breathe and to make sounds. 
				<br>It has a kind of muscular membrane that prevents water from entering the body when the dolphin is submerged.</li>
				<br>
            </ul>
       </li>
	   <li>Mouth
            <ul>
                <li>Located in the front area of ​​the head, it has several teeth whose number varies according to the species, but they are around 80-100. 
				<br>The jaws are elongated and play a significant role in the sensory system of the dolphin.</li>
				<br>
            </ul>
       </li>
	   <li>Melon
            <ul>
                <li>It is a spherical organ located in front of the skull, used for echolocation. 
				<br>The rounded shape of this mass of adipose tissue is what gives dolphins the shape of their forehead.</li>
